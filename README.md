# Compiler Design for COOL programming language
### Intro
COOL is a small language designed for use in an undergraduate compiler course project by Stanford University. 
Cool has many of the features of modern programming languages, including objects, automatic memory management, and strong static typing.
It generates code for a MIPS simulator.
